These were a bit time consuming but well worth it. The dough needed more than 4 cups of flour to achieve the correct texture. Personally, I liked how the doughnut holes tasted better than the doughnuts.  The outside has a crispy sweet crust while the middle was soft. We coated the doughnuts in a cinnamon and sugar mixture.  Regardless both are delicious! A must make again! Will be freezing a bunch and I hope they taste just as good afterwards."}, {"user": "Janet Shum", "note": 5, "comment": "Delicious!

Much better than the cheater doughnuts we usually do (using refrigerated, premade biscuits)! They are addictive, but I was looking for more of an apple flavor, given the name. I followed the recipe, but should have added more flour or let the dough refrigerate before trying to roll out and cut them. Definitely a keeper, with a few minor adjustments!

My husband & sons & other family members always enjoyed my food.\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve never been able to accomplish was good fried chicken. My mom\u2019s mom (granny) always made the best pan fried chicken. Crispy, golden brown & juicy.  \n\nWhen I was a teen & into my 20\u2019s, I would watch granny make her fried chicken. Mixed together flour, salt, black pepper, paprika.  Rolled the wet chicken pieces in the flour mixture & fried chicken in a cast iron skillet. She made a beautiful cream gravy for the mashed potatoes.\n\nMy mom tried frying chicken & never was successful, same with me. I would end up with at best mediocre fried chicken along with a waste of my time, a greasy & flour mess in my kitchen!\n\nAfter not making fried chicken for about 20 years, I thought my husband & I would make this recipe. Followed the recipe, except for Dijon mustard (I can\u2019t imagine including this in fried chicken).  Soaked the chicken, breaded it & let set on a rack for 30 minutes. Used a cast iron skillet, used our temperature gauge to try & keep the oil @ 350 degrees.  It took quite awhile to fry the chicken, leaving an oily & flour mess.\n\nThe chicken got too dark, breading was soft not crunchy (I was wondering about the wisdom of including baking powder in the flour), the breading was flat tasting.\n\nNEVER again will I make fried chicken! KFC for us."}, {"user": "MOOSETRAX75", "note": 1, "comment": "I wanted this to be good so badly. It was not. I wanted to try a new way to fry chicken. Every single bit of this crust fell off my chicken and I ended up with nekkid as a jaychicken pieces. Served the blobs of crust on the side and advised hubby to interchange bites. It had pretty good flavor but nothing to write home about. I'm stickin with my tried and true Grandmother's approach, which involved nothing more than salt, pepper, flour and fry it up. THAT worked.
